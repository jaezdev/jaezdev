Blogging has been around for decades, but in 2025, it still matters—especially for developers. With the rise of social media, AI-generated content, and ever-changing platforms, you might wonder: why keep a blog at all? Here’s why I believe blogging is still relevant, and why I continue to share my thoughts, ideas, tutorials, and dev stories here.

## Owning Your Platform

Social networks come and go, algorithms change, and content can disappear overnight. A personal blog is a space you control. It’s your archive, your voice, and your history—unfiltered and uncensored.

## Sharing Knowledge

The tech world moves fast, but the fundamentals remain. Tutorials, code snippets, and lessons learned from real projects help others (and my future self) solve problems. Blogging is a way to give back to the community that taught me so much.

## Documenting the Journey

Development isn’t just about code—it’s about the process, the mistakes, and the small wins. Writing about challenges and solutions helps clarify my thinking and creates a record of progress over time.

## Building Connections

A blog is more than a personal notebook. It’s a way to connect with other developers, exchange ideas, and start conversations. Comments, emails, and collaborations often start with a single post.

## Staying Relevant

Writing forces me to articulate ideas clearly and stay up-to-date. Explaining a new framework or tool means I have to understand it deeply. Blogging keeps my skills sharp and my curiosity alive.
